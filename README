A countdown clock in HTML.

Mostly because doug fried his countdown clock.

Speciality: chaning positions & sizes for the 'days'

Install Instructions
1. Have a raspi running the latest raspian
2. Get internet onto that raspi.  Wired or wireless.

In my case, used an edimax AC600.  Install instructions here: https://edimax.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/14000032146-how-to-install-ew-7811-ac600-series-adapter-on-raspberry-pi

3. clone this repo to ~.  "git clone ...."

4. Make sure date is correctly set, and that ntpdate is running so date is correctly set after a reboot.

Note that ntp and/or openNTP don't work on cal visitor.  You either need to be on a different wifi, or figure out a workaround to get the time on boot.

5. Edit the file to auto-start the scripts.  Note: there are many ways to auto-boot scripts. Unfortuantely, most of the go-to options (I.E. Crontab) doesn't work here, because of graphics driver problems.

navigate to the LXDE autostart file: cd ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/

edit the autostart file: sudo nano autostart

add the following line to the bottom: @/home/pi/Desktop/countdown/script.sh

Then, close the file (CTRL-X, then "Y").
